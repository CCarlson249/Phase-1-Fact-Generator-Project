# Phase-1-Fact-Generator-Project

Random Fact Generator Site

The Pitch: Our Team (Clayton Carlson and Myles Reyburn) will be building a site that utilizes the Useless facts API found here (http://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/) to generate facts at random for the user to interact with through multiple events. User interactions and inputs will be stored on a separate JSON server so that submissions can be stored on the site.

The User experience: Upon visiting the site, users will be able to:
-reroll the fun fact for a different one
-add likes or dislikes to the current fun fact
-submit comments to the comment section
-hover their mouse over comments to reveal a button they can use to delete comments

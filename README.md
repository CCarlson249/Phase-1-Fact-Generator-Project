# Phase-1-Fact-Generator-Project

Random Fact Generator Site

The Pitch: Our Team (Clayton Carlson and Myles Reyburn) will be building a site that utilizes the Useless facts API found here (http://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/) to generate facts at random for the user to interact with through multiple events. User interactions and inputs will be stored on a separate JSON server so that submissions can be stored on the site.

The User experience: Upon visiting the site, users will be prompted to click a button that generates a completely random fun fact in the form of a post. A random image along with the fact will also be displayed. The user will be able to click on a Like or dislike button on the post. Additionally, users will be able to enter comments through a submit form below and will be displayed on the side of the page.
